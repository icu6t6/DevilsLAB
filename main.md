# DevilsLAB

Personal lab for embedded systems, control electronics, and experimental builds.

This repository is used for:
- Early-stage designs
- Firmware experiments
- Hardware notes and schematics
- Versioned release snapshots

Nothing here is polished.
Projects become their own repositories once stable.
