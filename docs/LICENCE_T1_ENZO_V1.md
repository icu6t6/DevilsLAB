# T1-ENZO v1 — Educational ESP32 Firmware & Reference Project

## IMPORTANT — READ FIRST
This project is **NOT a physical product or kit**.

**T1-ENZO v1 provides:**
- Firmware
- Pin mappings
- Reference wiring logic
- Documentation
- Educational structure

**T1-ENZO v1 does NOT provide:**
- A robot
- A chassis
- Motors
- Batteries
- Power electronics
- Any assembled hardware

You are expected to source, fabricate, or design your own hardware.

## What This Project Is
T1‑ENZO v1 is an **educational embedded‑systems firmware baseline** designed to help learners move from
“I can follow tutorials” to “I can design and reason about a complete system.”

It focuses on:
- Power architecture (12V → 5V → logic)
- Grounding strategy
- GPIO planning
- Modular firmware structure
- Safe expansion paths

This is **not** a toy demo or copy‑paste project.

## Who This Is For
You should be comfortable with:
- Arduino / ESP32 basics
- Uploading firmware
- Editing Python files
- Basic electronics concepts

You do **not** need to be an expert.

---

## What You Will Learn
- Why grounding matters
- How to separate high‑current and logic domains
- How to plan GPIO usage
- How to structure firmware cleanly
- How to expand without breaking a baseline

---

## Completion Criteria (v1)
T1‑ENZO v1 is considered complete when:
- Firmware boots successfully
- LEDs respond as expected
- Buttons register correctly
- PIR input is stable
- No pin conflicts exist
- Files are named exactly as specified

---

## Baseline Rules
- Do not rename files
- Do not partially copy files
- Replace entire files only
- Maintain pin assignments
