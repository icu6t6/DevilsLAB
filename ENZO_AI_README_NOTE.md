## AI Assistance During Assembly (Optional)

ENZO may be built alongside an AI assistant for explanation and learning.

All architecture, wiring, and firmware provided are complete, deterministic, and known-good on their own.  
If AI assistance is used, configure it using the provided guidance so it stays aligned and constrained.

Read these files first:

- `ENZO_AI_ASSISTED_BUILD_GUIDE.md` — the supported workflow and boundaries
- `ENZO_AI_SETUP.md` — the mandatory copy/paste alignment block

Rule of thumb: the AI explains ENZO. It does not redesign ENZO.  
If the AI disagrees with ENZO, **ENZO wins**.
