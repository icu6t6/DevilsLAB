# T-1 ENZO v1 — Overview

## What is T-1 ENZO?

T-1 ENZO is a hands-on learning robot kit built around the ESP32 microcontroller.

It is designed to teach real-world electronics, power systems, wiring discipline, and firmware structure — not just “plug it in and it works”.

You build a tracked robot from the ground up, wire it correctly, flash real firmware, and end up with a system you actually understand.

This is not a toy and not a finished consumer robot.
It is a learning platform.

## Who is this for?

T-1 ENZO is for people who:

- Want to learn ESP32 properly, not just blink LEDs
- Want to understand power rails, grounds, buck converters, and sensors
- Are comfortable learning step-by-step, even if new
- Want something physical to build, break, fix, and improve

You do not need formal qualifications.
You do need curiosity and patience.

## What will you learn?

By completing T-1 ENZO v1, you will learn:

- How to safely distribute input rail source power "2-cell LiPo" and 5V power in a mobile system
- What a common ground is and why it matters
- How to use buck converters correctly
- How to wire sensors, LEDs, buttons, and motors to an ESP32
- How firmware maps to real hardware pins
- How to flash, edit, and extend MicroPython firmware
- How to structure a project so it can grow

---

## What do you end up with?

At the end, you will have:

- A tracked ESP32 robot that:
  - Boots with LED status states
  - Reads sensors
  - Drives motors
  - Is fully editable and expandable
- A working understanding of how it actually works
- A project you can modify instead of starting over

---

## What this is NOT

- Not a plug-and-play toy
- Not a polished consumer product
- Not locked-down firmware
- Not “AI out of the box”

Those come later, if you choose.

---

## How long does it take?

- Build time: ~1–3 evenings (depending on experience)
- Skill level: Beginner → Intermediate
- Tools required:
  - Soldering iron
  - Screwdrivers
  - Computer (Windows/Linux/macOS)
  - Patience

---

## What do you receive?

T-1 ENZO v1 is provided as a digital learning kit, including:

- Step-by-step build guide
- Full wiring instructions
- Editable firmware
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Software setup guide

Hardware is sourced separately.

---

## Why does this exist?

This project exists because learning electronics is often:

- too abstract
- too locked down
- too hand-wavy

T-1 ENZO is built around understanding, not shortcuts.
