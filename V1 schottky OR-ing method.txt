# ENZO V1 — Power & 5V Isolation Wiring (Schottky Channels)

**Status:** As-built / Canon reference

This document describes the final, verified power architecture and the dual-Schottky 5V isolation scheme used in **ENZO V1**. It reflects the physical wiring that has been tested and confirmed working with:
- Battery only
- USB only
- Seamless handover without back-feed

## 1. Power Source Overview

### Battery Path
```
Battery → Fuse → Schottky (reverse protection) → Source Rail → Buck Converter → Latching Switch → 5V Rail (A)
```

### USB Path
```
USB → ESP32-S3 5V Pin → Schottky Channel A → 5V Rail (A)
```

## 2. 5V Rail Isolation (Dual-Schottky Scheme)

### Channel A — USB / ESP → Rail
- From: ESP32-S3 5V pin
- To: 5V Rail (A)
- Diode orientation: Grey band faces the rail

### Channel B — Rail → ESP
- From: 5V Rail (A)
- To: ESP32-S3 5V pin
- Diode orientation: Grey band faces the ESP

## 3. Loads on the 5V Rail
- Voltmeter
- Latching switch LED
- OLED
- RGB
- PIR
- DHT22
- ESP32-S3 (via Channel B)

## 4. Verified Behaviour

| Scenario | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Battery only | OK |
| USB only | OK |
| Battery + USB | OK (no backfeed) |
